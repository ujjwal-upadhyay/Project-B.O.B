This is a project that can be used for collecting objects like plastics in the water bodies to reduce **water pollution**.

✪ **Components of Project B.O.B:-**

➛ Base part

➛ Collecting tank

➛ Vertical axis wind turbine(VAWT), to generate wind energy.

➛ Conveyor belt, which collects objects and transfer them to compressor.

➛ Propellers, planted on the bottom of base part to generate tidal energy.

➛ Solar panels, planted on the floor of base part to generate solar energy.
